\textbf{Centralized Chat System}\\
\textbf{NGUYEN Vu Bao Hung}\\
\textbf{Introduction}\\
In this project, I will develope a chat programme that acts as a chat room. One client can send message to and receive message from all other clients.\\
The system works with non-blocking multiplex TCP socket.\\
\textbf{The Client}\\
The client programme is separated into 2 threads, one for handling input and one for displaying messages. This helps user to see new messages as they come and let them send message at any time.\\
The main thread will continue to wait for incoming message.\\
The input thread will wait for user input.\\
The network thread will send the user input to server.\\
The input thread and network thread are synchronized by a mutex such that once the input message is received, it is sent to server.\\

\textbf{The Server}
The requirement of the project is to use Fork and Pipe for each client. But I could do that properly so I have sent two version of servers, one works but do not use fork and pipe, one use fork and pipe but not working.\\

Version 1\\
This version works but do not use fork and pipe.\\
All clients are managed by one process, once a message is received, it is sent to all other process.\\

Version 2\\
This version do not work but implement Fork and Pipe technique.\\
Their will be a different child process for each client.\\
Their are 2 pipes for each child-parent pair.\\
The child process will read from Pipe 1 and write to pipe 2 which duplicates stdout.\\
The parent process will write to Pipe 2 which duplicate stdin and read from Pipe 1.\\
